Approaching Software Design
When designing software, I start by identifying the main objective of the project. I then create a wireframe or pseudocode to outline the structure and functionality. Recently, I've developed new design skills related to 3D graphics, including coding 3D assets and working with OpenGL. Before this course, I had no experience in these areas, although I had experimented with 3D art using Blender.

Design Process and Future Applications
For my project, I followed the course modules to build each component of the 3D scene, including rendering objects, setting up the camera, applying textures, and configuring lighting. I approach program development by breaking down large projects into smaller, manageable tasks and tackling each one step by step. This method ensures steady progress and helps maintain focus.

New Development Strategies
While working on my 3D scene, I utilized existing libraries and formulas instead of creating everything from scratch. This strategy saved time and allowed me to leverage proven solutions.

Iteration and Evolution of Development Approach
Iteration played a crucial role in my development process. Each step helped me understand the concepts better and visualize the project more clearly. Although some concepts took time to grasp, breaking the project into smaller pieces provided a sense of progression and achievement. My approach to developing code has evolved to be more structured and iterative, leading to the successful completion of the project.

Role of Computer Science in Achieving Goals
My goal is to become a professional software developer specializing in full-stack web development and mobile development. Computer science is integral to achieving this goal, as it provides the foundational knowledge and skills required for these fields.

Impact of Computational Graphics and Visualizations
Educational Pathway: Computational graphics and visualizations have deepened my appreciation for graphics and game engines created by other engineers. If I decide to pursue this field further, I will need to dedicate more time to learning these skills and concepts.

Professional Pathway: These experiences have taught me how to work with existing libraries, formulas, and code. They have also enhanced my understanding of graphics, color, and space. These skills will be invaluable in my professional aspirations as a Full-Stack Web Developer and Mobile Developer.
