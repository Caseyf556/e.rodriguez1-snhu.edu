The project focused on object-oriented program design and modular design concepts, enabling the breakdown of complex problems into manageable components. The process involved initial conceptualization, detailed design using UML diagrams, prototyping, and iterative refinement based on user feedback. The project introduced new design skills, such as advanced 3D modeling techniques and shader programming, which are essential for creating realistic visual effects. The 3D scene was developed using event-driven programming and efficient data structures for user interactions. 
Iteration was a crucial aspect of the development process, with each cycle improving the scene both functionally and visually. The approach to code development changed from ad hoc to disciplined and methodical, ensuring high-quality and maintainable code. Computer science teaches skills applicable to everyday problems, particularly in computational graphics and visualizations, making it essential in both educational and professional fields. This new skill will enable the creation of visualizations for data analysis and simulations, allowing for the development of sophisticated software solutions.
